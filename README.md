The project aims to investigate the property prices of Beijing from 2011 to 2017 and gain insights into the market trends. 

Data is stored using HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System) and analysed using Apache Spark's SparkSQL in Jupyter Notebook with Python. Jupyter Notebook, Spark master and worker nodes, and HDFS nodes all run in separate docker containers orchestrated together using Docker Compose and are deployed on a GCP VM Instance.

The time period is investigated as it captures a critical time of rapid urbanisation and real estate boom in Beijing’s real estate market. As Beijing’s the capital and a major financial hub of China, it also reflects the broader Chinese market, understanding the property price movements of the city offer consumers, including buyers, sellers and real estate developer’s valuable insights into the period of real estate boom so they can use this as reference for future decision making, such as in other markets currently experiencing real estate boom, like Australia.
